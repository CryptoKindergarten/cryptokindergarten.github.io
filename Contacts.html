    Crypto kindergarten is something I have been considering doing for a while and slowly but surely am putting together. The idea came about as I believe there is a large proportion of people that do not know about the real value propositions that Crypto/blockchain technology are offering. I believe this is the case as I was also the same for many years and did not actually start researching anything very seriously till about 2021. Until this point I believed it was mostly nonsensical made-up currencies completely driven by FOMO and fraud. I believed this because I never looked any deeper, I never scratched the surface.<p> 
 
Once I actually took a little time to look deeper I realized that there was a real applicable value to the technology. It is an efficient, secure, transparent and cost-effective system that has the potential to revolutionize the way we transact with assets.  The more and more I learned the more I was surprised at how long it took me to stumble across the information in the first place. I believe that the negative noise prevented me from looking any closer, and I believe that there is a good chance there are many of you do the same. You may look at the same information I do and decide I'm completely wrong about the utilization of the technology, and you may decide that I am delusional and the whole market is nothing but FOMO and pipe dreams. You might not be wrong. The only statement I feel comfortable saying to you with complete honesty is this:<b> It is worth a little time to learn more about this technology so that you can understand and decide for yourself.</b> <p>
If I can convince you of that much then I've done my job. Even if you just find me annoying and don't want to watch my videos, if I can convince you to learn elsewhere on your own then that's cool, I'm not getting paid for any of this, you aren't a customer. Part of my reasoning for putting this together is to better articulate my arguments, not just for you, but for myself as well. It's healthy to evaluate my positions and challenge myself to be sure I'm not wasting my time here either. On that note if you are a naysayer and want to give me your reasons why, I will listen to them with an open mind, I'm not afraid to admit I'm wrong if you can convince me.
