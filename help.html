 <b>1. Like Share and Subscribe</b><p>
Go to My linktree and follow me on Youtube, twitter and Instagram. Send your cryptoskeptical friends, aunts, uncles, mothers etc. to my videos. Liking and sharing is absolutely the best way to help support this project. It is very important and I am incredibly thankful for any and all that support. 
<p>
<b>2.$$$$$Money Money Money$$$$$</b><p> 
I am prepared for and planning to run this operation with no outside support, barebones and minimal minimal cost. You may be asking yourself,  " I dont understand, it looks like 
you've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars". Guess what? so far I haven't spent anything other than the cost of web service and my time. So if this masterpiece can be done virtually free, imagine how much better it would be with tens of dollars from community members
like you. I have two fund pools that I will be shilling:
<p>                                                                                                                               
<b>Pool 1 - Advertising (Show it):</b> 85% of the funds in this pool will be allocated to advertising. This means strategic ads on google, twitter, youtube etc. I might also consider targeting overlooked audiences with things like radio advertising and free local seminars if my videos
find any real success. 
All expendetures and receipts will be made available for this pool to assure everyone there is no funny business. You can donate to this fund using on any EVM compatable chain by sending funds to : <b>0x1b9cba79FBD6D875d072e2Fc2cb6Aa1cbff7D107 </b>, please include a message if you are wanting to support a specific video. Receipts will be posted for this wallet <p>

<b>Pool 2- Tip Jar (Grow it) :</b> The funds from this pool would be used to pay for operational expenses (including myself) such as creating content, web design, and other improvements. 
You can donate to this pool using on any EVM compatable chain by sending funds to: <b>0x1B4dd2ff67D3c41cdB2cfd07C7825027db500CF0</b> <p>
