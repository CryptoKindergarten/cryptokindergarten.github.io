        <p> 1.  A public blockchain allows us to share data in a secure, transparent fashion without giving anyone special authority to control it. This allows us to create systems of sharing and exchange that eliminates middlemen, reduces fraud, is highly secure, completely transparent and is much more efficient than other systems. 
<p> 2.	Blockchains are built linearly and chronologically, meaning you cannot alter the past and the newest data always goes on top of the older data.  </p>

  <div class="expand-section">
 <div id="TLDRB" class="expand-content" data-marker="TLDR">  
     <p>So what is TLDR? TLDR is an acronym. An acronym is a word or phrase formed from the initial letters of a longer name or phrase, usually in a way that makes it easier to remember or refer to. Acronyms are often pronounced as a single word and are typically created by taking the first letter of each word in a multi-word name or phrase. TLDR stands for Too Long, Didn't Read. To truly understand the acronym TLDR we need to carefully analyze each word in the acronym. The word Too, not to be confused with 'two' or 'to', which are both homonyms of Too. A homonym is a word that shares the same spelling and, often, the same pronunciation with another word but has a different meaning. Homonyms can be classified into two main categories <p></p>
          
1.Homographs: These are homonyms that have the same spelling but may have different meanings and may or may not have the same pronunciation <p>
2.Homophones: These are homonyms that have the same pronunciation but different meanings and often different spellings.<p>
In this case the word too is a homophone of two and to. Too can have two different but similar meanings. To keep it simple, we will disregard the first meaning of too that does not apply to the acronym of TLDR, that disregarded definition would be 'in addition to'. In the case of our 'too' we will defer to definition two of two for too which is 'to an excessive degree. <p>
The next word you must understand properly is the word long. Long can as well have various meanings particularly as a form of leverage training. For our purposes this long means, extended in length, specifically, the length of a particular writing. Long is of course subjective in this manner. One person may find a couple paragraphs to be too long. Did you know that there are books written that contain multiple millions of words. I hadn't till I started writing this. I'd post a link here but I think that would make this definition feel a little too bloated don't you think. The point is one person's too long is another person's too short, this of course is not to be confused with the 80's and 90's and 2000's American rapper Too Short. <p>
Next word to analyze is Didn'tâ€¦.not much to say here, it's just a contraction of did and not. Maybe we shouldn't be calling it TLDR, maybe it should be TLDNR as contractions really don't belong in acronyms IMO. Imo is a acronym meaning 'in my opinion', sometimes people say IMHO to say 'in my humble opinion', however, in my humble opinion I find that calling yourself humble is not a humble thing to do so you may find yourself in an infinite catch-22 loop if you are not careful. Catch22 is a phrase that essentially means you are trapped in a impossible or contradictory dilemma. The term originated from a book of the same name. Catch-22 has nearly 175,000 words in it, probably "Too Much" by most people's standards these days. Of course, now I am showing my age, complaining about the youth of today and their wanting everything in bite size little pieces. No time to sit and read 3 pages of technical jargon. I suppose it's time for me to fill out my DNR, which means Do not resuscitate, which is not to be confused with my aforementioned TLDNR which is the proposed new acronym. "Too Long, Do not Resuscitate" sounds like the title of a book. I would write it, but it would likely be too long. <p>
The final letter in TLDR is the R which means Read, not to be confused with its past tense homograph read, pronounced 'red' and is not to be confused with the primary color Red. Nor should you be confusing 'past' with its homograph 'passed'. You should also not be confusing my previous use of the verb 'tense' with it's homonym which is also a verb 'tense' nor with its homonym the adjective tense, nor with this homograph 'tens' and if you are confusing it with its homograph 'tents' well you are just way off fren.  Read in this context means to interpret and comprehend. 
So now that we understand the words that make up this acronym we can discuss what they mean when you put them together. "Too long didn't read". This is a phrase that can be used to tell someone that they need to condense the information they are sharing, it can also be used to proudly declare your own ignorance. If you give someone the TLDR, you assume they will not read the whole thing and you are giving them the condensed version. To be fair there is often a lot of bloated information out there, and when it starts to get technical it can be hard to follow. You will find your eyes following the words but you stopped processing what they mean in your head. Your really just sitting there, blankly allowing the words to enter your brain while you think about what you are going to eat, or maybe what you are going to watch on tv, or who is gonna win the big foosball game. If your mind is a wandering mind that needs constant stimulation then keep a lookout for the folks who are willing to read through the more technical mumbo jumbo and distill it into the TLDR for you. Have you watched Succession yet, it's really good, you should. Sorry I kind of forgot what we were doing here.
